    <p id="about">
      We buy already profitable (mostly SaaS) internet products for a fair price and implement best practices to grow them into sustainable companies. We use the profits from current companies in our portfolio to buy new ones.
    </p>

    <h3>What types of companies do you buy?</h3>
    <p>Right now, we're buying profitable SaaS products that have an ARR (annual recurring revenue) of <strong>$35,000 to $250,000</strong> which have a high margins and high CLV (customer lifetime value).</p>

    <h3>What do you pay for a company like that?</h3>
    <p>We pay somewhere between 2 and 5 times L12M (last 12 month's) <strong>profit (net income)</strong>, depending on factors such as growth, customer churn, margins and customer lifetime value.</p>

    <h3>Tell us more. Are you like a VC or private equity or a conglomerate or what?</h3>
    <p> 
    We're not sure. We're not a VC since we buy 100% stakes in the companies we run. 
    We take inspiration from companies like Berkshire Hathaway and Constellation Sofware that run good businesses and give great returns to their investors without much fuss.
    </p>
    <p>
      Our motto is: work hard and be nice to people.
    </p>
