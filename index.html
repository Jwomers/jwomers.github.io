    <p id="about" class="editable">
      We buy already-profitable (mostly SaaS) Internet companies for a fair price and then implement best practices to grow them into sustainable companies. To finance these purchases, we use the profits from companies that are currently in our portfolio.

    <h3 class="editable" id="types">What types of companies do you buy?</h3>
    <p class="editable"  id="types-content">Right now, we're buying profitable SaaS companies that have an ARR (annual recurring revenue) of $35,000 to $250,000. These companies have a high margin and a high CLV (customer lifetime value).</p>

    <h3 class="editable" id="pay">What do you pay for a company like that?</h3>
    <p class="editable" id="pay-content">We pay between 2 and 5 times the company&apos;s L12M (last 12 months&apos;) profit, or net income. The exact figure will depend on factors such as growth, customer churn rate, margins, and customer lifetime value.</p>

    <h3 class="editable" id="tell-more">Tell us more. Are you a VC, or a private equity firm, or a conglomerate, or something else?</h3>
    <p class="editable" id="tell-more-content">We're not sure. However, we're not a VC since we buy 100% stakes in the companies we run. We take inspiration from companies like Berkshire Hathaway and Constellation Software, which run good businesses and give their investors great returns without much fuss.</p>
    <p class="editable" id="tell-more-content-2">
      Our motto is: work hard and be nice to people.
