      We buy already profitable (mostly SaaS) internet products for a fair price and implement best practices to grow them into sustainable companies. We use the profits from current companies in our portfolio to buy new ones.

    <h3 class="editable" id="tell-more">Tell us more. Are you like a VC or private equity or a conglomerate or what?</h3>
    <p class="editable" id="tell-more-content"> 
    We're not sure. We're not a VC since we buy 100% stakes in the companies we run. 
    We take inspiration from companies like Berkshire Hathaway and Constellation Sofware that run good businesses and give great returns to their investors without much fuss.
